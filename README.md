# Bank Management System in C

This is a simple **Bank Management System** written in C language.  
It allows both **Admin** and **User** access with basic banking operations such as account creation, login, password management, viewing statements, and deleting accounts.  

The project uses **file handling in C** to store account details in a text file (`Ban.txt`).
